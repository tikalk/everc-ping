# ðŸš¢ HELM Introduction

Helm helps you manage Kubernetes `applications` â€” Helm Charts help you `define`, `install`, and `upgrade` even the most complex Kubernetes applications.

Charts are easy to `create`, `version`,`share`, and `publish` â€” so start using Helm and stop the copy-and-paste.

## ðŸ¥¼ helm lab will cover:

1. Work with existing charts
2. Write our own helm-chart for ping pong application

## Some âš“ HELM âš“ High-Level Structure

When you create a `Helm chart` for the first time, this is the typical structure you will find: 

```yaml
mychart/
â”œâ”€â”€ Chart.yaml                  - depdency lock file (more on that in a bit)
â”œâ”€â”€ charts                      - A folder for dependencies (Other charts / library charts)
â”œâ”€â”€ templates                   - All the processesd templates
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ NOTES.txt               - helm installation info notes (which are templated too)
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ _helpers.tpl            - helm templating functions
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ hpa.yaml                - a template for `hpa - horisontal pod autoscaler`
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ deployment.yaml         - a template for `deployment`
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ ingress.yaml            - a template for `ingress`
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ service.yaml            - a template for kubernetes `service` 
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ serviceaccount.yaml     - a template for kubernetes `service account` 
â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ tests                   - helm tests 
â””â”€â”€ values.yaml

3 directories, 9 files
```

### Templates

The most important piece of the puzzle is the *templates/* directory. This is where Helm finds the YAML definitions for your `Services`, `Deployments` and other Kubernetes objects. 

If you already have definitions for your application, all you need to do is replace the generated YAML files for your own. What you end up with is a working **chart** that can be deployed using the helm install command.

It's worth noting however, that the directory is named *templates*, and Helm runs each file in this directory through a [Go template](https://golang.org/pkg/text/template/) rendering engine. Helm extends the template language, adding a number of utility functions for writing charts. Open the *service.yaml* file to see what this looks like:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: {{ include "pingalicious.fullname" . }}
  labels:
    {{- include "pingalicious.labels" . | nindent 4 }}
spec:
  type: {{ .Values.service.type }}
  ports:
    - port: {{ .Values.service.port }}
      targetPort: http
      protocol: TCP
      name: http
  selector:
    {{- include "pingalicious.selectorLabels" . | nindent 4 }}
```

This is a basic `Service` definition using templating. When deploying the chart, Helm will generate a definition that will look a lot more like a valid Service. We can do a dry-run of a helm install and enable debug to inspect the generated definitions:

Let's debug the helm install command against our k3d cluster's api like so:

```sh
helm install --dry-run --debug my-pingalicious ./deployment/helm/charts/pingalicious
```

This should yield the following:

```yaml
... (... == removed for redability)

HOOKS:

NOTES:
1. Get the application URL by running these commands:
  export POD_NAME=$(kubectl get pods --namespace default -l "app.kubernetes.io/name=pingalicious,app.kubernetes.io/instance=my-pingalicious" -o jsonpath="{.items[0].metadata.name}")
  export CONTAINER_PORT=$(kubectl get pod --namespace default $POD_NAME -o jsonpath="{.spec.containers[0].ports[0].containerPort}")
  echo "Visit http://127.0.0.1:8080 to use your application"
  kubectl --namespace default port-forward $POD_NAME 8080:$CONTAINER_PORT

```

### Values

The template in *service.yaml* makes use of the Helm-specific objects *.Chart* and *.Values*. The former provides metadata about the chart to your definitions such as the name, or version. The latter *.Values* object is a key element of Helm charts, used to expose configuration that can be set at the time of deployment. The defaults for this object are defined in the *values.yaml* file. Try changing the default value for *service.internalPort* and execute another dry-run, you should find that the targetPort in the Service and the containerPort in the Deployment changes. The *service.internalPort* value is used here to ensure that the Service and Deployment objects work together correctly. The use of templating can greatly reduce boilerplate and simplify your definitions.

If a user of your chart wanted to change the default configuration, they could provide overrides directly on the command-line:

    $ helm install --dry-run --debug deployment/helm/charts/pingalicious --set ingress.enabled=true ...

For more advanced configuration, a user can specify a YAML file containing overrides with the *--values* option.

### Helpers and other functions

The *service.yaml* template also makes use of partials defined in *_helpers.tpl*, as well as functions like replace. The [Helm documentation](https://helm.sh/docs/chart_template_guide/getting_started/) has a deeper walkthrough of the templating language, explaining how functions, partials and flow control can be used when developing your chart.

### Documentation

Another useful file in the *templates/* directory is the *NOTES.txt* file. This is a templated, plaintext file that gets printed out after the chart is successfully deployed. As we'll see when we deploy our first chart, this is a useful place to briefly describe the next steps for using a chart. Since *NOTES.txt* is run through the template engine, you can use templating to print out working commands for obtaining an IP address, or getting a password from a Secret object.

### Metadata

As mentioned earlier, a Helm chart consists of metadata that is used to help describe what the application is, define constraints on the minimum required Kubernetes and/or Helm version and manage the version of your chart. All of this metadata lives in the Chart.yaml file. The [Helm documentation](https://helm.sh/docs/) describes the different fields for this file.

This covers the overview - well highlight the rest during the hands-on labs.
